## Structure Of LeNet :

LeNet5 is a small network, it contains the basic modules of deep learning: convolutional layer, pooling layer, and full link layer. It is the basis of other deep learning models. Here we analyze LeNet5 in depth. At the same time, through example analysis, deepen the understanding of the convolutional layer and pooling layer.

LeNet-5 Total seven layer , does not comprise an input, each containing a trainable parameters; each layer has a plurality of the Map the Feature , a characteristic of each of the input FeatureMap extracted by means of a convolution filter, and then each FeatureMap There are multiple neurons.
